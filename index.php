			<h2>Dutch Grand Prix to return at Zandvoort from 2020</h2>
			<p><strong>Formula 1 is delighted to announce that the Dutch Grand Prix returns to the FIA Formula 1 World Championship from 2020. An agreement has recently been signed between Formula 1 and Dutch Grand Prix – a partnership formed by SportVibes, TIG Sports and the Circuit Zandvoort – and will run for at least three years.</strong></p>
			<p>Furthermore, Heineken, one of the longstanding Global Partners of Formula 1, will be the Title Sponsor of the event.</p>
			<p>Situated not far from the vibrant city of Amsterdam, Zandvoort is a major beach resort in the Netherlands, known for its long beach bordered by magnificent coastal dunes separating the North Sea from the track. The Circuit of Zandvoort has a long history as a Formula 1 venue, and over the coming months, the facility will be rebuilt with help from Zandvoort town council and several other partners. The track and the infrastucture will be modified in order to meet the standards laid out by the FIA in order to host a Formula 1 World Championship event.</p>

			<h2>The Winners and Losers of the Spanish Grand Prix</h2>
			<p>For one team, the trophy cabinet needed reorganising to find yet more space, while for others it was back to the drawing board after a testing weekend at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. We pick out the winners and losers of the Spanish Grand Prix...</p>
			<p>It was not the cleanest weekend for Lewis Hamilton. In fact, it has not been the cleanest season. He was uncomfortable in the car at Barcelona, and struggled with the tyres in qualifying once again, which meant he was beaten to pole by team mate Valtteri Bottas for the third time in a row.</p>
